# Extractive Summarization Approach with Graph Architecture

## Project Overview
This project presents a novel graph-based approach for **extractive text summarization**, aiming to improve the quality and coherence of automatically generated summaries. The model represents texts as graphs, capturing semantic relationships using **TF-IDF**, **BERT embeddings**, and **graph centrality algorithms**.

## Key Features
- **Graph-Based Text Representation**: Nodes represent sentences, edges represent semantic relationships.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Integration of **TF-IDF** and **BERT** for improved sentence ranking.
- **Summarization Quality Metrics**: Evaluation through **ROUGE** and **BERTScore** metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NLP libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, BERT
- **Graph algorithms**: PageRank, TextRank
- **Data Analysis**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, NetworkX
